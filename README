nConvert v1.1
Author: ashwini@majestik.net


 This utility will convert a simple, human-readable Contacts CSV to a format that's
 compatible with Nokia PC Suite. Had to write a utility to do this because standard
 Microsoft Outlook CSV exports weren't reading in Nokia PC Suite. Eventually
 I figured out it was because Nokia PC Suite wanted all these extraneous fields
 in the CSV, and the file had to have utf-16 encoding. Obviously! ;)



 Format your Contacts CSV like this: "First Name","Last Name","Mobile Phone"
 Anything after the first 3 fields is ignored. F1 = First, F2 = Last, F3 = Mobile.

 Then run 'python nconvert.py' and get a compatible CSV which you can import! Done!


 Tested w/ Python 2.7.1
