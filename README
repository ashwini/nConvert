nConvert v1.1
Author: ashwini@majestik.net


 This utility will convert a simple, human-readable Contacts CSV to a format that's
 compatible with Nokia PC Suite. Had to write a utility to do this because standard
 Microsoft Outlook CSV exports weren't reading in Nokia PC Suite. Figured out it was because
 NPCS wants all these extraneous fields and utf-16 encoding. Obviously. :)

 Format your Contacts CSV like this: "First Name","Last Name","Mobile Phone"




 Just run 'python nconvert.py' to start.

 Tested w/ Python 2.7.1
